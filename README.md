#### [**_Math class teaches a computer to channel J.S. Bach_**](https://natsci.source.colostate.edu/math-class-teaches-a-computer-to-channel-j-s-bach/)

The code for class-project reproducing the article [**_"LSTM: A Search Space Odyssey"_**](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7508408)
=======

Take it easy, this is just a class project from 2019. I'm no LSTM-expert, and the code hasn't been reviewed ever since submission.
